# CatChat!

## A ReactJS + FeathersJS + SocketIO + MongoDB Chat Application. 

###Info:

CatChat is made with a [ReactJS Front-end](https://github.com/khalilgharbaoui/catchat-react-js-front-end), connected to a FeathersJS / SocketIO / ExpressJS, [Back-end API](https://github.com/khalilgharbaoui/catchat-feathers-js-mongodb-api-back-end) that uses MongoDB.
We basically created this app during our traineeship at Codaisseur to get familiar with diffrent kinds of frameworks.

###Team

  - [Margot Sauter](https://github.com/navase)
  - [Khalil Gharbaoui](https://github.com/khalilgharbaoui)


###TODOS

My personal goal is to add:

  - ability to add emoji's
  - ability to add user authentication.

### Installation:

Download both the Front-end and Back-end and run the following commands for both of them:

  ```bash
  npm install
  npm start
  open http://localhost:3000
  ```
